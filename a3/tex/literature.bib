  abstract  = {Abstract This article is intended for both undergraduate and advanced students, and for physicists and materials scientists, who want to know more about the basics and the state of the art of pulsed laser deposition (PLD). PLD is a rapidly developing and widespread growth technique for both thin films and nanostructures, mainly in research environments, but with beginning industrial impact. Here, the important basic and technological aspects of PLD are treated in a concise way, and possible additional reading is given.}
