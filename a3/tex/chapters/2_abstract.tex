\paragraph{Abstract}
This lab report examines different applications of Hall effect 
measurements. 
It includes an investigation of silicon (\ce{Si}) at room temperature, 
an analysis of temperature-dependent measurements of \ce{Si}, and a 
discussion of a complex dataset from a \ce{ZnO} thin film fabricated 
by PLD.
