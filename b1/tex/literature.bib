	abstract = {Microelectronic Circuits by Sedra and Smith has served generations of electrical and computer engineering students as the best and most widely-used text for this required course. Respected equally as a textbook and reference, "Sedra/Smith" combines a thorough presentation of fundamentals with an introduction to present-day IC technology. It remains the best text for helping students progress from circuit analysis to circuit design, developing design skills and insights that are essential to successful practice in the field. Significantly revised with the input of two new coauthors, slimmed down, and updated with the latest innovations, Microelectronic Circuits, Eighth Edition, remains the gold standard in providing the most comprehensive, flexible, accurate, and design-oriented treatment of electronic circuits available today.},

	abstract = {Solid-state devices have complex energy storage effects that complicate their transient operation. A frequently used method of analysis is that of charge control. This method relies upon quasi-static equilibrium and may have significant errors for high-speed operation. The method proposed uses a series approximation to a convolution integral solution. The first term of the series is equivalent to charge-control operation and higher order terms provide improved accuracy in terms of lumped elements of an equivalent circuit, but the real merit of the series form is its ready adaptability to computer- programmed node-branch circuits analysis.},

	isbn = {978-0-521-80926-9},
	abstract = {At long last, here is the thoroughly revised and updated third edition of the hugely successful The Art of Electronics. It is widely accepted as the best single authoritative book on electronic circuit design. In addition to new or enhanced coverage of many topics, the third edition includes 90 oscilloscope screenshots illustrating the behavior of working circuits, dozens of graphs giving highly useful measured data of the sort that is often buried or omitted in datasheets but which you need when designing circuits, and 80 tables (listing some 1650 active components), enabling intelligent choice of circuit components by listing essential characteristics (both specified and measured) of available parts. The new Art of Electronics retains the feeling of informality and easy access that helped make the earlier editions so successful and popular. It is an indispensable reference and the gold standard for anyone, student or researcher, professional or amateur, who works with electronic circuits.},
