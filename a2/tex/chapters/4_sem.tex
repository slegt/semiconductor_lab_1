The schematical structure of a scanning electron microscope is shown in
\cref{fig:general_structure}. It consists of a cathode which emits
electrons. 
The electrons are accelerated by an anode and focused into a 
nanometer-wide beam by multiple magnetic lenses.

The goal of a \ac{sem} is to probe the sample at different spots.
To achive this, one can use the magnetic field of a coil, which deflects
the electron beam. 
With that, the electron beam is rasterizing over the surface. 
Different detectors are located close to the sample to measure different 
interaction-products of the colliding electrons with the sample atoms. 
As a result, it is possible to gain an intensity signal, which
depends on the electron beam position.


For older devices, the rasterized electron beam is synchronized
with a CRT. 
In newer devices, the signal is digitized and can be outputted in
various formats. 

\subsection{Electron Beam Generation}
Electrons can be generated through thermionic emission.
In this experiment, a tungsten hairpin cathode is used.
The cathode is heated up to \qtyrange{2600}{3000}{\kelvin} to overcome
the work function of \qty{2.5}{\electronvolt} through thermal 
excitation.
The cathode is surrounded by a Wehnelt-cylinder, on which a voltage is 
applied.
The cylinder is used as a first focusing mechanism.
This is schematically visualized in \cref{fig:wolfram}.

There also exist \ce{LaB6} cathodes, which consist of a small rod-shaped
lanthanum hexaboride single crystal. 
This crystal is heated up indirectly to \qtyrange{1700}{2100}{\kelvin}.
Due to the lower work function of \qty{2.7}{\electronvolt} the cathode
can work at a lower temperature. 

Apart from thermionic emission there also exist field emission, where
the quantum mechanical tunneling effect is utilized to generate electrons.
This provides a more precise beam but is also more complex to operate.

\subsection{Electron Lenses}
After being emitted by the cathode, the electron beam cross-section 
needs to be reduced further. 
In order to to achieve this, electron lenses are used.
The most common architecture are magnetic coils with rotationally 
symmetric fields. 
The field amplitude is gaussian-shaped along the symmetry axis.
When the electrons arrive at the coil, they are forced to move in a helix 
trajectory and merged into the focal point. 

As with optical lenses, electron lenses show a variety of  
aberrations, which need to be considered.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Spherical aberration} occurs because off-axis electrons 
		are deflected more strongly than on-axis electrons, resulting in a 
		shorter focal point. Spherical aberration increases at large 
		aperture angles. 
	\item \textit{Axial astigmatism} is an imaging error related to the
		magnetic inhomogenities which leads to a deviation from rotational 
		symmetry. 
		This deviation causes different focal points for different beam 
		planes. 
	\item \textit{Chromatic errors} are another type of aberration 
		which originates from the velocity distribution of the electrons. 
		Different velocities result in different wavelengths and different
		focal points. 
	\item \textit{Diffraction errors} occur because of the small aperture
		angle and the resulting single slit interference of electron waves.
		This leads to a blurred lens focus.
		As diffraction errors increase with small angles and spherical 
		aberrations increase with large angles, one can find an optimal 
		angle which minimizes the total error. 
\end{itemize}
