    abstract = {Temperature-dependent Hall-effect measurements in hydride vapor phase epitaxial GaN grown on sapphire can be well fitted over the temperature range 10â€“400 K by assuming a thin, degenerate n-type region at the GaN/sapphire interface. This degenerate interfacial region dominates the electrical properties below 30 K, but also significantly affects those properties even at 400 K, and can cause a second, deeper donor to falsely appear in the analysis. However, by using a two-layer Hall model, the bulk mobility and carrier concentration can be accurately ascertained.},
