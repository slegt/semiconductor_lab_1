\paragraph{Abstract}
This lab report examines different applications of Hall effect 
measurements. 
It includes an investigation of silicon (\ce{Si}), zinc oxide (\ce{ZnO}),
zinc tin oxide (\ce{ZTO}) and copper iodide (\ce{CuI}) thin films at room temperature, 
an analysis of temperature-dependent measurements of bulk \ce{ZnO}, and a 
discussion of a complex dataset from a \ce{ZnO} thin film fabricated 
by PLD.
